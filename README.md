This in an entry for this game jam: https://itch.io/jam/-pixel-game-jam-2024

The jam theme is: Aqua

# General Concepts:

We are targeting the Playroom category.
Players are attempting to navigate through a desert from oasis to oasis. 
 - Graph from point A to B? Like a FTL level maybe?
They can rest and resupply at oases.
The primary resource driver is water (due to the theme).  
Your goal is to get from point A to B without dying of thirst.
You get to pick when to travel and when to rest.
- Follow cloud cover to reduce water loss?
- Longer you travel without resting, the faster water depletes
- Resting still depletes water
- Traveling during the day burns more water, but is safer from random encounters
- Traveling at night burns less water but has high risk of random encounters
You can search for water in an area (sorta like hunting for meat in Oregon trail).
- Maybe find a cactus, trade health (or not if you have the right tools) for water
- Use dowsing rods to search for water under ground
  - Come up with some interesting way for those to work and find non-water goofy things
Multiplayer elements
- Persistent caravan death sites players can stumble on and resupply from
  - The more people try and fail, the easier for future players?
- Trade and social interactions in town?
- Coop caravans?
- PvP? Can you lie in wait and ambush other players?
